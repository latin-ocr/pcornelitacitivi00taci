The object of this Series is to furnish rapidly a considerable
number of editions of Greek Authors, the notes of which shall
be sound and practical, and present the best'results of recent
research and criticism.

To this end the volumes of the Series will be based upon
recent German editions, the notes of which will be translated
into English with more or less freedom. The plan admits
additionS‚ substitutions‚ and omissions‚ but always in such way
as to indicate what part of each volume is due to the American
editor.

The notes will be on the same page with the text 3 but there
ἱ will also be a separate edition of the text in solid pages without
notes. The volumes cf the Series will be bound in paper, but
will be securely sewed‚ and will have their leaves cut.
