organized province.

13. Bona fortunaeque: the manuscript reading is quite unin-
telligible3 bona fortunae quae in tributum aggerat annus in
frumentum . . . conterunt. The emended reading here given ap-
pears to be the best. Annus is used for the yearly produce3 see
Germania, Chap. 14.

tary roads were constructed with such solidity that they were like a
fortification, and the word regularly used for making roads was
munire viam.

of purchase‚ and then applied to the objects conveyed by this for-
mality, was in later times used especially for slaves. - semel, only
once.

are subdued for purposes of gain, we for destruction.

Trinobantes3 Calgacus, however, mentions the Brigantes of North-
ern Britain, probably as being better known to the Caledonians.

29. libertatem: the manuscripts have in libertatem. By this
expression he means that the Caledonians will not sink into supine-
ness, socordia, as the Britons had done3 paenitentiam means
“ change of purpose.''
