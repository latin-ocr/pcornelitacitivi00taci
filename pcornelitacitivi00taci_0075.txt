consulship was A.D. 40, that of Collega and Priscus was A.D. 93.

29. quarto: the manuscripts read VIO, which, as is easily seen,
does not correspond to the dates of his birth and death. The mis-
take is one very easily made.

27. Ι. quantum ad gloriam, sc. attinet.

3. consulari: this is the manuscript reading, which many
change to consularibus But he did not enjoy the consularia
ornamenta (see note, Chap. XL), but the consular dignity itself‚
and was therefore consularis. ⁷

6. incolumi dignitate: see in the next chapter, the indignities
which followed soon after his death.

8. sicuti . . . ita, although . . . yet. The words non licuit are
not found in the manuscripts.

10. augurio votisque: these words describe his sagacity in
foreseeing the coming man, and the earnestness of his desires.

source. ’

summoned the Senate.

a son of Helvidius Priscus, mentioned in Chap. ΙΙ.

the Julian gens. - visus is, by zeugma, subject of perfudit (z per-l
culit).

23. Senecio: see Chap. II.

32. ejus: Tacitus passes here from address to narration.

28. 3. ante quadriennium: Tacitus was praetor A.D. 88, and
appears to have left Rome the next year for some office in a province.

He returned to Rome shortly after the death of Agricola. Γ
