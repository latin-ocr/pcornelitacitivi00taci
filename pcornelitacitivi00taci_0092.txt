GlNN, HEA TH, &⁴ 6035 PUBLICA TIONS.

 

This Series will embrace such Latin classics as are corn-
monly read in American colleges, with some others that are
well adapted for such use, but are not now available for lack
of suitable editions. The several volumes will be prepared by
special editors, who will aim to present a carefully revised text,
with introductions and commentary‚ embodying in a practical
form adapted to the use of college students, the best results of
recent philological research. The notes will be on the same
page with the text, but there will also be a separate edition of
the text alone.
