lee sze os Agricola. 61

CHAPTER XLI.

35. laudantes. not laudatores, which would mean a person
who made this a practice3 the participle is strictly temporary,-
those wlzo pra-ise one. This praise is sometimes understood as
ironical, of secret enemie53 it is better to understand it of the
inopportune, although sincere, praise of injudicious friends3 see
optimus quisque libertorum below.

25. 5. limite: this word properly ’means a path left as a
boundary between two estates ; from this there is a natural transition
to a boundary line. Under the empire it is used for a fortified
frontier.——ripa: no doubt from what goes before, the banks of
both Rhine and Danube were meant3 the special reference is, how-
ever, to the Danube, where the Goths invaded the Roman provinces.

6. possessione, sc. provinciarum.--damnis, dative.

7. omnis annu5‚ tlze whole year. '

12. optimus quisque: these were the laudantes referred to
above. ·

14. deterioribus, neuter.

16. praeceps agebatur: z'.e., to a glory which was his ruin.

CHAPTER XLII.

17. proconsulatum Asiae et Africae. In his previous com-
mands, Aquitania and Britannia, Agricola had acted simply as
legatus or deputy of the emperor, in administering provinces of
which the emperor himself was in theory governor; it was now his
time to become himself the governor. proconsul, of a senatorial
province (see note, Chap. VII.). This office, in which the gov-
ernor had, in theory, independent power, was superior in dignity to
that of the imperial provinces, in which the governor was only a
deputy3 but it was inferior in effective power, because he exer-
cised only civil authority. It was bestowed, as in the republic, on
men who had held magistracie53 Asia and Africa alone to those
who had been consuls ς the other nine to 'past praetors. But, whereas
in the Republic they were given to the magistrates immediately upon
leaving their office, under the empire there must be an interval of
some yearS,-—at this period generally thirteen years. (Marquardt,
Rb'misclze Staatsverwaltnng, i.‚ p. 405.) The office was held for only
a year at a time. (Mommsen, Rbmisclzes Staatsreclzt, i., p. 234.)
