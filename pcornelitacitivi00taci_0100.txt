Α German Grammar for Sohools and Colleqea

By WVILLIAM COOK of Harvard College.

This Grammar is intended to be simple enough for boys and
girls who have never studied any other language than their own,
but it will, at the same time, call attention to kindred usages in
F rench and the classical languages, —with which college students
have already some familiarity,— and thus render the acquisition
of German easier to these latter. It is intended to be the first
and the last grammar in the stuclent’s hands,—— not only to teach
him the first elements of the language, but to serve continually
afterwards as a work of reference while reading or writing German.

It will aim, in the first place, at greater clearness, and then at
greater completeness, than the grammars now generally studied.
Suitable use will be made of Lehmann’s works on the language
of Lessing, Goethe, etc., of the articles on grammatical points in
the A rclziv fiir das Studium der neueren Spraclzen, of the author's
memoranda made while reading many different German books

with college classes, and of the dictionaries — especially the Dic· ⁴

tionary of the Main Difficulties of the German Language—of
the author's valued correspondent, Professor Daniel Sanders.
The alphabetical index will be made up by the author him-
self, and contain‚ it is hoped, every single topic in the text.
Should space allow, exercises on the plan of Heyse's, consisting,
that is, of German sentences containing grammatical mistakes,
will be introduced into the body of the text. The Prefixes and
Suffixes, the Particles‚ the Modal Au'xiliaries, ancl the Order ofthe
disserent elements of the Sentence‚ will he treated with special
care. On these and other subjects of more than usual difficulty
or importance to the average student, the author invites sugges-
tions. [ln prqmzration.
