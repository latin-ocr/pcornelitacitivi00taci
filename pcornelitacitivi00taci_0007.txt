INTRODUCTION.

 

UBLIUS* CORNELIUS TACITUS, the greatest of the
Roman historians, flourished in the reign of the Emperor
Trajan (A.D. 98-117). There is no positive evidence as to
the place of his birth, or its date, or the time of his death. A
tradition of no great value makes him a native of Interamna.
This was the birthplace of the Emperor Tacitus, who claimed
kinship with the historiari. As to the year of his birth, we know
only that he was somewhat older than his intimate friend, the
younger Pliny, who was born A.D. 61 or 62. Pliny himself says
(Epp. vii. 20) that they were propemodum aequales ,Î‡ but adds z
asulescentulus, cnm jam tu foma gloriaque floreres, fe sequi. . .
concupiscebam. These expressions may point to a difference in
age of four or five, possibly even eight or ten, years: we can-
not well place the birth of Tacitus earlier than 51 or later than
56. The best authorities are generally agreed upon A.D. 54.
Two or three considerations tell in favor of an earlier
date. In the Life of Agricola (Chap. III.) he appears to reckon
himself among those who, being juvenes at the accession of
Domitian, had arrived od seneclutem under the rule of that
tyrant. Now forty-five was the ageos senectus according to
Roman law 3 and as Domitian died in 96, Tacitus can hardly

have been born much later than 51. Again, the narration of

* His praenomen has been usually given as Gaius, but is now generally
accepted to have been Publius, on the authority of one of the best manu-
scripts.
