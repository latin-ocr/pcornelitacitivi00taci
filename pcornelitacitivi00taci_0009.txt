full and minute, but in a more finished and maturer style. It
consisted of sixteen books, and embraced the period from the
death of Augustus, A.D. 14, to that of Ner0„A.D. 68, Four

Tacitus was in theory a republican, and had no liking for the
empire. He knew very well that the Republic could never be

that when engaged in the prosecution of a cruel and unjust
provincial governor, he spoke eloquentissime et, qdod eximimfz
orationi ejus inest, <remae—which last word we may render,

Nepos, but a personal tribute of affection and admiration by
