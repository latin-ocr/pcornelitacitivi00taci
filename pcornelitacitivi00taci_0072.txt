have not held the office or dignity itself. As, under the empire, the
honor of a triumph was restricted to the emperor, private citizens
ν could only have the ornamenta triumphalia; and of these the
most important—the laurel crown, the sceptre, the gilded throne
—were confined to the emperor. The ornamenta granted to
Agricola could, therefore, have been hardly more than the toga
praetexta. (Mommsen, Rbmz‘sclzes Stczatsreclzt, i.‚ p. 378.)

12. majoribus: Syria was an imperial province of the first rank,
governed by a legatus consularis, in this ranking with Britain and a
number of others3 but it ranked as the most important province in
a military point of view, being on the fronticr opposed to the great*
rival empire of Parthia—Credidere plerique, it was generally

their former masters, and in close personal relation to them, like

ally transferred from the hill to the edifice, in which sense it has
passed into the modern languages as pellace. The name Palatium
is derived from that of Pales, goddess of herds and flocks, upon
whose festival, the Palilia (April 21), common tradition placed the
founding of Rome. (Preller, lss'o'mz'sclce stsytlcologle, p 364.)
