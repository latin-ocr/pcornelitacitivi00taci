The Lffe of Agricola. 53

fifteenth century. As to the locality, it is plain from the expres-
sion praemissa classe, etc.‚ that the scene of the battle was near
the sea-shore. At any rate, it is far from likely that Agricola
reached a point so far north as the Grampian Hills; and moreover
the battle would not receive its name from a great range of moun-
tains, but from some moderate hill which the enemy had invested,
—quem hostis J'am insederat.

10. pugnae prioris: z'.e.‚ of the former year3 Chap. XXVI.

15. cruda ac viridis senectus: this phrase is taken from Ver-
gil, AEn. vi. 304.

16. decora, badges oflzonor.

CHAPTER XXX.

21. animus, confidence.

23. nullae ultra terrae: z'.e.‚ for refuge.

28. in nostris manibus : contrasted with those Britons by
whom in the previous battles certatum est.

29. eoque : this is the manuscript reading, which has been
altered into iique, on the ground that their nobility was no reason
for their occupying the penetralia of Britain. But if we consider
nobilissimi to be used in its primitive sense, as relating to birth, we
shall see that the purast born, the azctochtlzmzs, would naturally be
in ipsis penetralibus siti.

30. servientium: z'.e.‚ the Gauls‚ who were subject to Rome.

32. terrarum ac· libertatis extremos ε one of Tacitus' nervous
expressions, — tlte remotest on tlze earth, and tlze last refuge of free-
dom. For the nationality of the Caledonians, see note on Chap. XI.

33. sinus famae: this figure is taken from the sinus or pouch
made by a fold in the toga, and is best explained as meaning the
obscurity of slzez'r fiune,- recessus ac sinus may be regarded as a
kind of hendiadys‚— the obscurity of fame resulting from distance.

34. Atque omne ignotum, etc. ε as long as we were unknown,
we were dreaded. But now that we are reached, this dread can no
longer exist, for there is no other nation beyond us, which can take
⁵ our place. “

18. 3. defuere terrae: they have no more lands to conquer.

8. imperium is to be joined with appellant3 this sentence is a
powerful example of Tacitus' sententious eloquence, as indeed is the
whole speech of Calgacus.
