one of his own household. No classica] work is therefore bet-
ter fitted to form part of a course which aims to contain only ”
what is intrinsically best and most characteristic. It is one of
those tom'c writings which help to elevate and strengthen the
moral nature and build up character.

My airn, in the present edition, has been to 'meet the needs
of such a course. I have left special philological training to
the teacher, only making occasional reference to the leading
grammarS. On the other hand, I have undertaken to explain
the historical references with great fulness, and to give needful
assistance in all real difficulties. In the text I have for the
most part followed Kritz, but have not hesitated to vary from
it when there seemed to be good reason, especially in several
cases to restore the reading of the-manuscripts. In preparing
the commentary, I have been chiefly assisted by Kritz, but have
also made use of Drfigen Church and Brodribb, and Freund.
My special thanks are due to Prof. TRACY PECK of Cornell
University, who has carefully read the whole proof, and whose
suggestions have frequently caused me to change or modify my
opinions.

It is my intention to follow this, as early as possible, with an

edition of the Germania of Tacitus.
