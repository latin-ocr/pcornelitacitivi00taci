Tetlow's Latin Lessons.

By JOHN TETLoW, AM„ Principal of Girls' Latin School, Boston.

This book is designed to teach the Latin Accidence, and to
prepare the way for the intelligent study of Caesar's Commen-
taries. The material used in the exercises set for translation
will be drawn mainly from Caesar 3 and, except so far as the
orderly development of forms and syntax imposes restrictions,
the material thus borrowed will be used without change. It
will be the aim of the author to facilitate :

(Ι) The development of rules from examples, instead of the
classification of examples under rules accepted on authority 3
(2) a thorough comprehension of the grammatical principles
enunciated, and a right appreciation of their relative importance,
through the number, variety, and due proportion of the illus-
trative sentences set for translation 3 (3) the adoption of estab-
lished reforms in Latin orthography, and the observance of
quantity in Latin pronunciation 5 (4) the gradual development,
by means of special exercises, of power to translate ‘⁶ at sight ” 3
(5) the acquisition, through the study of word—formation, of an
elementary knowledge of Latin etymology which, so far as it
goes, shall be scientifically correct.

The book will be adapted to Allen and Greenough‘s Gram-

mar, but will be supplied with parallel references to Harkness
and Gildersleeve. · [Ready sune J, 1883.
